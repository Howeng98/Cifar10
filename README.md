Objective of this project is to classify the datasets which include some images like(ship,dog,cat,airplane,deer... e.g.)into **10** labes. And our model predict accuracy is **0.74**ï¼Œ most of the researcher also got **0.66 ~ 0.78** accuracy with these datasets, so our model sounds good! We use the ``Cifar10`` datatsets for practice is because it only contain 10 different types of images in data,so you can go for ```Cifar100``` for larger datasets and details.
